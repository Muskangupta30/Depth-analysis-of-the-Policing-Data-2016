Conducted in-depth analysis of the Policing Data 2016 from Dallas, Texas, focusing on use-of-force occurrences to enhance policing procedures.

Employed R programming language and tidyverse package for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Implemented two-way tables to explore the association between officer gender and subject race, revealing potential disparities in the application of force.

Created visualizations, including bar graphs and dot plots, to illustrate the frequency of use-of-force incidents by officer race and distribution of officer years on force.

Utilized density plots and histogram plots to depict the distribution of numerical variables such as subject age and officer years on force.

Applied advanced visualization techniques, including violin, box, and Sina plots, to analyze the distribution of force incidents by reporting area.

Conducted scatter plot and pair plot analyses to examine relationships between numerical variables in the policing data.

Utilized correlation analysis to identify the strength and direction of the link between officer years on force and beat, revealing a weak negative correlation.

Implemented time series plots with smoothing to visualize the increasing trend of use-of-force incidents over time.

Developed an interactive map using the leaflet package to display hotspots and geographic distribution of force incidents based on location and subject race.
